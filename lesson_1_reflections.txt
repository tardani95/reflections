How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I see the changes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can see how a program was developed

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create
a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like
Google Docs does?

    Perhaps it saves too early or too late, you will not know which version to
    if something goes wrong

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each
file separately?

    Because it developed for developers/programmers
