When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I want to colloborate with others, if I work on multiple devices.

	fork: when you clone a gitHub repository to your gitHub profile
	clone: you can clone someones gitHub repository, or your repositry on GitHub or on your local computer, when you clone, it copies all the histroy, what it has done on the project
	branch: is a branch of your project, ....
