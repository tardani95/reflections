When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I want to colloborate with others, if I work on multiple devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because collisions can occuour and I do not want to always fix them.
